# causal
My explorations implementing causal modeling. To goal is pedagogy,
like the motivation behind "Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs" and "Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics."

The causal modeling code takes its inspiration from:
- "The Book of Why," 2018
- "Causal Inference in Statistics," 2016

Notable namespaces:
- `causal.fcit`, an imcomplete/buggy/ham-fisted reimplementation of [Fast
  Conditional Independence Testing](https://github.com/kjchalup/fcit)
  ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02747))
- `causal.causal`, actual causal model stuff
